<hr />

<h3>#1 The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>
  Quite possibly the greatest movie of all time. It has everything. Fencing.
  Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men.
  Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and
  descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases.
  Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles. Who could ask for more?

<h3>#2 The Starwars Saga</h3>
<p>
  Another masterpiece of story and film. Lucas creates the first fully fledged
  space oddessy.
</p>

<h3>#3 So I Married an Axe Murderer</h3>
<p>
  Possibly Mike Meyers best film ever. It's a laugh a minute of relatable
  comedy.
